# HTML and CSS Practice - Template Two

## Overview

This repository contains a practice project for HTML and CSS, focusing on creating a responsive template. The purpose of this project is to enhance skills in front-end development by implementing a static webpage with various layout and design elements.

## Project Structure

- **index.html**: The main HTML file containing the structure of the webpage.
- **styles.css**: The CSS file that styles the HTML elements to create the desired look and feel.
- **images/**: A directory containing all images used in the project.

## Features
